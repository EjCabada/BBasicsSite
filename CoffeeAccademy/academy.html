          <h3>Coffee Beans & History</h3>
          <p>
            Coffee beans are the seeds found inside the ripe red coffee cherry
            fruit. They are found all over the world throughout the equatorial
            region of the globe (called the coffee belt).
          </p>
          <p>
            Drinking coffee originated almost 500 years ago when it was first
            discovered in the wild of Ethiopia. No one knows exactly how it
            started but legend has it that a goat hearder called Khaldi first
            discovered it when he saw his goats become hyper after eating the
            coffee cherry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, after the export of the coffee fruit all over the globe,
            coffee can be found in 3 general regions with distinct flavor
            profiles. Whit various exceptions, these genreal coffee flavor
            profiles are as follows:
          </p>
          <div id="profileChart">
            <div id="profileList">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  South America: South American coffees are known for having
                  very chocolaty and nutty tastes. These are generally your
                  traditional coffees that most people are used to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Asia Pacific: Asian Pasific Coffees are known for their
                  "spicy" tastes such as cinamon, nutmeg, coreander, ect. A
                  particular popular coffee here is Sumatra, and the yearly
                  favourite Christmas Blend (a barel aged Sumatra coffee)
                </li>
                <li>
                  Afric: Africa is very eunique in the coffee world, it is the
                  place where it all started. Most of the coffee in the world
                  comes from 2 original coffee plant types, and therefore while
                  eunique, most coffees will have a similar taste. In africa
                  though, you have various coffee varietals that have never
                  before been categorized (originally lumped into a large group
                  called Heirloom varietals). Coffees from africa will have some
                  of the most fruity tastes in the world, such as blueberry,
                  cherry, and in the case of many Kenyan coffees keylime.

          <h3>Coffee Roasts</h3>
          <div id="roastChart"></div>
          <div id="roastExplination">
            <p>
              Green Bean: This is the original state of the coffee after it is
              picked in the fields and processed. It has a yellow, green or
              tanish collor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Blonde Roast: Once the coffee begins to roast, it will reach a
              light brown collor, the coffee here tends to be more citrucy, and
              has a more plant/ vegetable taste. Individual coffees tend to
              retain most of their eunique characteristics
            </p>
            <p>
              Medium Roast: Medium roasts popular around the world tend to
              balance the brightnes of the coffee with the more developed smokey
              tastes of a darker roast.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dark Roast: most of the eunique flavors and acidity are gone,
              insted you end up with a developed roast that is more smokey and
              in some cases more bitter than other roasts. Darker roasts are
              more popular with milk or Espresso based drinks since it's harsher
              flavors can still be tasted throught the milk and the syrups.
